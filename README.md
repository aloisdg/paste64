# Paste64

Paste64 is a tool I have built to scratch an itch. I wanted to be able to paste any image from my clipboard (mostly screenshot in my case) to get its base64 version so I can integrate it directly in any markdown. So Paste64 was born. [Try it online!](https://paste64.vercel.app/)

It was also an excuse to try out Svelte.
